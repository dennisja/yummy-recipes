Meet yummy recipes, my challenge during the Andela Bootcamp. Its inspired by the fact that keeping track of awesome food recipes is a need for many individuals who love to cook and eat good food. With it you will be able to create, save, share and keep track of those recipes, the one that matter. I'm shy to say that it might not be able to read your minds, or your social networks to see the recipes you cherish. But it will get you covered without worrying about moving with a big notebook to remember those recipes if you have your smart device.
